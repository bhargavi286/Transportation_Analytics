"# Transportation Analytics Project" 
Transportation Analytics & Fuel Efficiency Prediction
Overview

This project was developed as part of an internship task to analyze transportation and logistics data, derive operational insights, and build a predictive model for fuel efficiency. The solution follows a complete data analytics lifecycle, from raw data processing to model deployment using an interactive dashboard.

Objectives

Perform end-to-end data cleaning and preprocessing

Integrate multiple transportation datasets into a unified analytics dataset

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns

Train and evaluate a machine learning model for fuel efficiency prediction

Develop an interactive dashboard for data visualization and prediction

Dataset Description

The project uses multiple datasets related to vehicles, drivers, fuel usage, maintenance, GPS routes, and delivery logs. These datasets are cleaned, standardized, and merged to create a master analytics file used for analysis and modeling.

Methodology

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing inconsistencies

Data Integration: Merging cleaned datasets into a master dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing fuel efficiency, delays, and correlations

Model Training: Training a regression model to predict fuel efficiency

Dashboard Development: Building a Streamlit dashboard for insights and predictions
